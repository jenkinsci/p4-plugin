	<b>Pinning a build at Perforce Label</b>
	<p>When a build is triggered by Polling, Build Now or an external
		Action, the workspace will flush only to the specified label or changelist number. Any other
		specified change or label will be ignored.</p>
	<p>Supports variable expansion e.g. ${VAR}.  If 'now' is used, or a
		variable that expands to 'now', then the latest change is used
		(within the scope of the workspace view).</p>
