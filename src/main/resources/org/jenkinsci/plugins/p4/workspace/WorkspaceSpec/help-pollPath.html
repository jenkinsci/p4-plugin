	<b>Polling Path</b>
	<p>Polling Path refers to specifying additional paths outside the client view mapping for polling. Once configured and saved, build the project to apply changes. These paths are registered with the project, and any detected changes during polling will automatically trigger a build. Only comma-separated values are allowed, with a maximum of 10 entries.</p>
